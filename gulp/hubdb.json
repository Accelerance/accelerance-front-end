This means that all their clients have direct access to their c-level executives, and it means as well that all their clients are able to have services tailored to their specific needs – whether this be adjustments in the technology being used, or specific changes in the methodology used to deploy services. </p>\n\n<p>Although Colombia isn’t the first place people think about for software development, the country has become extremely stable and politically aligned with the US in recent years, and their excellent infrastructure and relatively underutilized deep talent pool makes Colombia a new, hot near shore destination for the next decade to come at least!</p>",
